# Markdowns

Most informations can be found at [Markdowns](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

## Decription and purposes

Markdowns are used to format and style texts. You can mark stuff as **bold**, or *italic* and much more.

### Headings

You can put heading levels up to 6 to your texts with a number of # , for example :
1. A first-level heading with #
1. A second-level heading with ##
3. ...
4. ...
5. ...
6. A six-level heading with ######
These will probably greatly help you format your texts.

### Links

Multiple type of links can be added to your markdown files such as :
- Regular links, pointing to a [webpage](https://google.com) 
- Section links, pointing to a [section](#links)
- Relative links, pointing to other files in the project such as [README](READMD.md)
- Images

### Lists

- Regular lists like :
  - unordered lists
